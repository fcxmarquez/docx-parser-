# Sample Markdown Document

This is a sample markdown document to test the Markdown to DOCX converter. It includes various elements that might appear in a typical markdown file.

## Section 1: Basic Formatting

This paragraph demonstrates *italic* and **bold** text formatting. It also includes `inline code`.

## Section 2: Lists

Here's an unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And an ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Section 3: Links

Standard markdown link: [GitHub](https://github.com)

Citation-style link example: This statement is important ([Source](https://example.com))

Another citation example with multiple sources: This fact is well-documented ([First Source](https://example1.com)) ([Second Source](https://example2.com))

## Section 4: Code Block

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Section 5: Blockquote

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Conclusion

This is the end of the sample document. The converter should handle all these elements properly.
